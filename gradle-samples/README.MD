# SDK Samples

SDK Samples is a collection of sample applications to test and prove the Equo SDK.

## Using Gradle

You can run the application with Gradle. By default, it uses the main class `sdk.example.SimpleAppSample`. 

Run the following command in the command line:

```sh
./gradlew runMain

# or

./gradlew runMain -PmainClass=sdk.example.BrowserAppSample
```
